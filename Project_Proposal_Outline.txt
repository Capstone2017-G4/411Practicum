Project Proposal #1:
Vitals monitor which measures:
  a. Heart rate
  b. Respiratory rate
  c. Body temperature
in real time and plots data on a continuous graph.

Potential uses:
  1. Just monitoring someone's health
  2. A more advanced version of this is used in measuring vitals for racing drivers
  3. With add ons, it could serve as a remote monitoring system for anyone (nice to have, but we aren't sure if it can be realized)

Sensors:
  a. Electrodes for heart rate
  b. Stretch band for respiratory rate
  c. TMP36 temperature sensors
  
Outputs:
  a. Continuous graph plotted - parameter vs. time
  b. LEDs mimicking heartbeat
  
Plan:
  a. Develop circuits that work with a pre-built microcontroller
  b. Build our own microcontroller with an Atmel processor
  c. Replicate same operation on our built microcontroller

Project Proposal #2:
Hand motion controlled robotic vehicle

Description: This project would help disabled people operate vehicles by moving their hands. The motion controlled robotic vehicle would respond to the tilting of the transmitter that could either be attached to your gloves, watch or a band. My hand motion would act like a remote control and the vehicle could be a car or even their wheel chair.

Input: hand motion (controlling the accelerometer and using a transmitter)
Output: forward and backward motion of the robotic vehicle (using servo motors and a receiver)

Project Proposal #3:
Fire Extinguisher Robot

Description: This project is intended to help firefighter extinguish fires in extremly dangerous environment. The robot will be on a 2 wheel chassis, have multiple temp. and flame sensors and a spray pump.

INPUT: Air temp, IR flame sensor, Ultrasonic sensor.
OUTPUT: Wheel motors, and pump motor.
