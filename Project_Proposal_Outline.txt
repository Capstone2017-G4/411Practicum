Project Proposal:
Vitals monitor which measures:
  a. Heart rate
  b. Respiratory rate
  c. Body temperature
in real time and plots data on a continuous graph.

Potential uses:
  1. Just monitoring someone's health
  2. A more advanced version of this is used in measuring vitals for racing drivers
  3. With add ons, it could serve as a remote monitoring system for anyone (that's the ideal goal for this project, but we aren't sure if it can be realized)
